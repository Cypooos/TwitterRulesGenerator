tofu#4378 120) This rule is not a rule, but it is a rule about this rule not being a rule. Does that then make it a rule, a non-rule, or void? Oh, another rule is not to ask about the meaning or validity of this non-rule rule-filled rule. Understand?

Cat#2631 The Central Comittee has left the chat
Deleted User#0000 1091) The Central Committee has been reestablished. Rule no. 1090) is now officially invalid. Cat astrophic is banned from making any further rules and ac has been solidified into the rulemaking system. No attempts on removing him can be made, and this rule can not be made invalid. The Central Committee, however, may be banned in the future, but it's decisions remain forever.

deepadmax#0939 2248) Though times may seem dark and hope is lost, keep your eyes on that shimmer of light in the distance, for you will one day be near it, celebrating in it's glory.
deepadmax#0939 2249) @Robin MGP Here's a **specific** number for you, 2249.

Ham#4758 5234) My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.#

ObnoxiousRed#8937 5261) A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.[1] Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.

TSG#4769 6578) "6577 was wrong."
Wab.boi#3056 6579) The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "air"
djpixel#3139 6580) All code written for the missile shall be posted as a seperate rule. All code written this way shall be directly translated to english (word for symbol) without any variables, expressions, or equasions.

TSG#4769 6680) **its *rewind* time** ⏪
NICKCIN#0264 6681) *AAH THATS HOT*
TSG#4769 6651) It's ~~rewind~~ ***__FoRTnITe__*** Time (go back 30 turns)
RiceSan#5685 6683) When will there actually be rules in #rules lmao
chopstick#2890 6684) These are the rules
Pan#6833 6685) And not abiding by them leads to execution
SyiFyi#6720 6686) you must read EVERY rule
MrWhiskers666#7684 6687) you must memorize EVERY rule
SyiFyi#6720 6689) and you must recite them in voice chat within the next 2 hours
Pan#6833 6688) (since @SyiFyi skipped it) You must also tell dm me what rule 319 is
MrWhiskers666#7684 6690) rules 0001-1000 are multiple choice and they are worth 5 points each
Catalyst#2180 6691) rules 1001-2000 are opened ended and you will be expected to provide the full rule, down to the last character. They are worth [REDACTED] points each.

TSG#4769 6694) Say e
Krisztian08#6367 6695) Why the heck can anyone just write s### here
chopstick#2890 6696) cuz we can :D
gamer#9804 6697) all rules except this rule are invalid and should not be followed
Jak#6015 6698) All rules are now valid except @gamer's rule
chopstick#2890 6699) m'lady hours
gamer#9804 6700) people writing new rules here after must read all the 6699 rules written before my current rule and make sure their new rule doesn't violate any of them

Pan#6833 6702) do not don't do maybe avoid at all cost definitely don't or maybe do I don't know
sk#9135 6703) Hey, new user! Welcome to Disrupt's official discord. Curious about how you can get the green color to your name for this server? Well, read all 6703 rules, and take the examination on the official website to earn yourself the privilege of this pretty green hue to boast to your friends and family!
Natalie#0666 (Disclaimer: theres actually less than 3000 rules but the numbers are a little wack)
Pan#6833 6704) Completely disregard what VR Gay Waluigi said. It is totally not true, like at all.
RiceSan#5685 6705) Please do not, I repeat, DO NOT drink digital bread. It is bad for your health. Trust me. Whoever told you about drinking digital bread is trying to decieve you.
chopstick#2890 6706) :GWcorsairNomNomNom:  🍞
sk#9135 6707) Rule 6705 is deceitful. As Disrupt's Bread Connoisseur, drinking digital bread gives you plenty of carbs, which is something normal pieces of bread can't give.

Whispery Whale#4184 7123) Launching a game is like being an exposed, live wire. You're vulnerable. Anything could happen, from technical issues to another surprise release taking over everyone’s time, money, and, perhaps most important of all, their attention. Every little bug and imperfection that’s reported registers in my head as physical pain. There are only so many hours in the day, which means there are only so many problems you can conceive of, protect yourself against, or fix. So you do your best, which is the best that you can do, and you hope you don’t short out along the way.

But you don’t care because they aren’t your “bros” are they “bro” ??????? I didn’t think so “bro.” So next time you call someone bro just remember that it’s not funny to make fun of poor orphans with disabilities “bro.” Okay “bro” ?????????? By the way Chad’s having like a dope ass party and whatever  on Friday so like if you wanna go I’m down but like Chelsea’s like such a fucking bitch and like I think she’ll be there.

Catalyst#2180 7290) "So the whole game that our culture is playing is that nothing really happens unless it's in the newspaper. So when we're at a party, and it's a great party, somebody says,' It's too bad there wasn't a tape recorder'. And so our children begin to feel that they don't exist authentically unless they get their names in the papers, and the fastest way of getting your name in the papers is to commit a crime. And then you'll be photographed, then you'll appear in court, and everybody will notice you. It really happened if it was recorded. In other words, if you shout, and it doesn't come back and echo, it didn't happen." -Alan Watts:newline:(sorry it's a bit long)

Dozy#9999 3893) It has come to my attention that (what seems to be) the staff at Discord has sent out a warning to people regarding a potential attack/raid happening the 27th. We're not sure about the validity to this but figured that we might as well share the info here as well to make sure everyone stays safe. The message reads like this::newline::newline:We've got some bad news:newline::newline:As many of you may know, rumors have spread about an all out attack on discord on July 27th through the website discordgg.ga, the same people that did the free nitro ping raid a few weeks ago. It is highly recommended that you tread lightly or stay off of discord if possible.  Measures to take include enabling 2 factor authentication and LEAVE ANY SERVER THAT HAS KAWAII BOT:newline::newline:A bunch of you have probably already seen the image of the discordgg ga website with the Felix the Cat character whistling.:newline:To give a small recap: a few months ago a virus spread around Discord using the discordgg ga website. Basically an account would send you the webpage, which was designed to imitate Discord's browser page, and ask you for your login information. If you fell for the trap the virus spread to your account and the cycle continues.:newline:Those same guys have ominously announced a "surprise" for the 27th of July. Knowing the lengths that these people will got to to take information, it's important to be prepared.:newline:If you still haven't::newline:- Turn on the "dm scanning" option to safe mode:newline:- Remove your connections (Steam, Skype, Twitter...):newline:- Remove payment info:newline:- Remove the "Kawaiibot" from your own server, there have been reports of the bot being connected:newline:- Don't open ANY SUSPICIOUS LINKS. Double check them for small changes (Like how the original webpage is discord.gg and the fake is discordgg(dot)ga:newline:- Report any suspicious behavior:newline:- Inform other servers and spread the message:newline::newline:Panic doesn't get us anywhere, but your data is too valuable to be exposed to those who do want to abuse it.
Lur#0001 3894) Discord never sent out said warning - but still, don't go clicking links.
Queen Aesthetic#0946 3895) Unpopular opinion, anyone who clicks on shady links should loose their account on any online service.
Catalyst#2180 3896) I don't think those people are actually going to do anything. The thing about fearmongering is once people see that you *can* do something, you really don't have to do more. Any threats you make will be taken seriously, driven forward by people's own paranoia.

lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4031) **Cocky furries shall experience the wrath of this alien nerf gun. Gamers, rise up**
Starry Mic#5427 4032) @Jak HELP WE'RE BEING OPRESSED DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD::::
Pan#6833 4033) lol this is a 3v1, plus we have the power of ***God AND anime*** by our side
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4034) Gamers have been carefully crafted by god to be able to handle 3v1's, 5v1's and even a special gamer which has 3000+ hours on TF2 Or COD MO2 which can survive an 8v1. Gamers have god's side and none other claims are true.
Pan#6833 4035) You didn't spell his name with a capital G, therefore you're not a true believer. This man is a heathen, and is in no way to be affiliated with the Lord (also God is all about that acceptance and stuff, so yeh it doesn't really add up)
barrett#0001 4036) he could be talking about Zeus or something
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4037) god loves Gamers so much, that he allows them to spell his name without the capital G, and furries have been created by satan, to spite god with his amazing creation called "Gamers".
Pan#6833 4038) okay then, stop talking and start acting. Prove that the Lord's light shines upon you, and purge us heretics from the server. Surely that should be no problem for such a proud and ultimate being such as yourself
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4039) God is so disgusted with satan's creation "Furries", that he will at no cost, even with his powers touch these furries, that's why he sent us Gamers to destroy these furries with nerf guns.
Pan#6833 4040) I didn't ask the Almighty to start acting, I asked you. You claim to be able to destroy us. Well, we're waiting. Give it your best shot
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4041) Obviously, not every gamer is Mod Or Admin on a discord server, if one was, he would've banned every furry on the server that he's a mod or admin. Instead, there's a Gamer V Furry war happening as we speak, with the gamers succeding (obviously) because of god's powers given upon the gamers.
Starry Mic#5427 4042) You havent done shit :/
Pan#6833 4043) huh. You claim furries will be exterminated by your, and I quote, "my epic gamer nerf shotgun that I stole from area 51 that can't be naruto outrunned". Well, I'm still here, @Starry Mic is still here, but I see no 'epic gamer' reinforcements
Starry Mic#5427 4044) c:
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4045) That's because you're not partaking in the war. If you were, you would've been eliminated long ago. After the Gamer V Furry war is over, and most of the furries are eliminated, the gamers will use their area 51 alien technology device to track down all of the remaining suvivors (i.e you), eliminate you and get the dub.
Pan#6833 4046) oh, but you're in the war? Then how do you have time to be a sorry internet warrior taking 7 minutes to write 4 lines of text? (actually more like 2 lines, but whatevs)
Pan#6833 4047) ***also,*** What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4048) Gamers have breaks on saturday, to get their skills better by playing COD MO2 Remastered online, thus giving them free time.:newline:Furries are also not allowed to join the navy seals, or military, so your statement is fake.
Pan#6833 4049) Actually, you're right. I'm not a part of the navy seals, as I live in Denmark. I am, however, part of the interforce, a Danish military organisation that helps provide peace in the EU (video for proof) I am also about to start training to join "frømænd", the most elite military organisation in Denmark
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4050) As a person that had to be in denmark for 2 months for the Gamer V Furry War and had also contacted many military bases to help us with this war (they did), I know for a fact that furries are not allowed to be in the military at all, and that video you sent is just a recording you found on the internet or a friend sent you one.
Pan#6833 4051) hmmmmmmm, it's almost as if you're full of shit
lemon demon (neil ciciriega)#6013 4052) Your video is so cringe, that my pc is not even loading it to shield my eyes from the cringe.

Stoney Bonehead [Gaming]#8899 4265. The sixmat is evil. Stay away from the sixmat. The fivemat is safe and has been deemed so by Jak. However, the sixmat is supposed to be a weapon free server, so if you see anyone with a weapon inside of the sixmat remember to act accordingly by drawing your weapon for the attack. Destroy all those with weapons.

Stoney Bonehead [Gaming]#8899 4274👁 one should know the difference between a horsicorn and a unicorn. Aside from the horn which makes it obviously a full unicorn, the horsicorn can trick you. As the horsicorn matures you might think you just have a horse. However, if the horse starts pooping Skittles you know you have a horsicorn. Until the horsicorn has matured tho? It’s all just horse shit.

RoyallyDawson#6225 4271) The numbers 2 - 9 included in any rule make said rule false while also making them true
[diamondstars]#2024 4272) There's only 1 unofficial-official rule and that is ***use common sense***
RoyallyDawson#6225 4273) Common sense is applied to the list below:newline:**EVERYONE**

Dokterkat#7493 4401) rules that aren't an normal rule can't be changed to another option in the rule list. This is an strong rule
TSG#4769 4402) Unless the rule is A Super, Infinity or [REDACTED]. (Strong as well but, that can be repelled.):newline:Only important rules can bear the Infinity rule, and can make others Infinity + Minority.:newline:Rules like [REDACTED] are special though.

Gilan#8377 4454) Hey, you. You're finally awake.:newline:You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits. No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening. Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? Why do you care? A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.:newline::newline:...looks like the Thalmor are with him.:newline::newline:General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. Good. Let's get this over with! Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.:newline::newline:Why are we stopping? Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.

You there. *Looks at Dragonborn* Step forward. *Dragonborn steps forward* Who are you?:newline:Dragonborn: Dragonborn Long-Shadow.:newline:Hadvar: Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim. Captain, what should we do? He’s not on the list.:newline:Female Captain: Forget the list. He goes straight to the block.:newline:Hadvar: By your orders, Captain. I’m sorry. We’ll make sure your remains get returned to Valenwood. Follow the captain, prisoner.:newline:Dragonborn: *moves to stand next to Ralof*:newline:Tullius: *steps up to Ulfric* Ulfric Stormcloak.

花🌸#4539 4590) My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

</Jehff_the_Crusader>#2235 5724) admin/staff help
Bwiaen#1083 5725) Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.

StarryEyes#7537 6002) cramping muscles can be caused by dehydration, weakness, or overuse.  Stretch it out, drink water, massage it. If it happens frequently you might be deficient in some minerals. Take some magnesium and potassium. You can also get the naturally in fresh foods!

SereneSkies#3915 6608) The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

Deleted User#0000 6920) let’s just keep it orderly and if anybody notices the count is off, just jump ahead and don’t say ‘cAlibRaTion’ as the term has just became annoying - while that is my fault.
SereneSkies#3915 6921) Not your fault. Just reading through the last 150 rules to see if I could make a joke come back for conversation and 90% of it was everyone saying, "Calibration," instead of just having unbiased-one-line fun, you know?
TSG#4769 6922) I see what you mean.
Deleted User#0000 6923) There is 3 pages of ‘calibration’.
TSG#4769 6924) oh god

TSG#4769 6926) I resign.
SereneSkies#3915 6927) Just didn't want this channel to die off because people were afraid of posting with the wrong number and then be shamed for it two seconds later when they are in the middle of editing.

The light produced by the flare was almost as intense as a mid-range nuclear blast: the area of 40 miles around Nicholson’s house was bright as daylight for some 40 seconds. After that, he aimed a military-grade million-watt spotlight directly at the windows of the house and simultaneously played a tape which contained recorded shrieks of dying pigs through a huge loudspeaker. As if the blinding lights and the abhorrent and deafening noises weren’t enough, Thompson then fired several rounds from his automatic handgun into the air.

This is explained deeper in the RP1 novel, but briefly explained in the movie. Both explanations should suffice as to why VRC and Roblox is nothing like The Oasis.

Nines#0099 7377) AITA I the asshole for killing my whole family?:newline::newline:Ok Reddit, so I (237,624 M) and my wife (6 F) got into a bit of an argument about Fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) on my (237,624 M) Xbox One X (released 2017). She (6F) wanted to play fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) on my (237,624 M) Xbox One X (released 2017) even though she (6 F) has a PS4 (released 2013), which I (237,624 M) destroyed. I (237,624 M) said no. She (6 F) hit me. So naturally, I grabbed my Unholy Hellbringer (crafted 200,000 years ago in Neptune’s core by demons), and killed her. I also killed our 32 of our boys, being Liam  (2 M), Noah (2 M), Elijah (2 M), Logan (2 M), Mason (2 M), James (2 M), Aiden (2 M), Ethan (2 M), Lucas (2 M), Jacob (2 M), Michael (2 M), Matthew (2 M), Benjamin (2 M), Alexander (2 M), William (2 M), Daniel (2 M), Jayden (2 M), Oliver (2 M), Carter (2 M), Sebastian (2 M), Joseph (2 M), David (2 M), Gabriel (2 M), Julian (2 M), Jackson (2 M), Anthony (2 M), Dylan (2 M), Wyatt (2 M), Grayson (2 M), Isaiah (2 M), Christopher (2 M), and Joshua (2 M). I saved Henry (2 M), because he (2 M) was my favorite child. I thought that he could be raised by wolves while i (237,624 M) played Fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) inside my house. While outside, I (237,624 M) dropped him (2 M) on the pavement and he (2 M) died. So Reddit, AITA I the asshole for killing my whole family?

Toxxi0n_777#1068 123) What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Timdeuces#4820 8367) koalas have smooth brains
Jak#6015 8368) What is oatmeal
Nameless Gonb#3760 8369) Oatmeal is a type of coarse flour made of hulled oat grains (groats) that have either been milled (ground), steel-cut, or rolled. Ground oats are also called "white oats". Steel-cut oats are known as "coarse oatmeal", "Irish oatmeal" or "pinhead oats". Rolled oats can be either thick or thin, and may be categorized as "old-fashioned", "quick", or "instant", depending on the cooking time, which is shortened by the size of the oats, precooking, and sometimes the addition of enzymes. The term oatmeal is also used in the U.S. and parts of Canada to describe a popular oat porridge made from either ground, steel-cut, or rolled oats. The oat grains are dehusked by impact, and are then heated and cooled to stabilize the oat groats – the seed inside the husk. The process of heating produces a nutty flavour in the oats. These oat groats may be milled to produce fine, medium or coarse oatmeal.  Steel-cut oats may be small and contain broken groats from the dehusking process (these bits may be steamed and flattened to produce smaller rolled oats).:newline::newline:Rolled oats are steamed and flattened whole oat groats. Old-fashioned oats can be thick and take a while to boil to make porridge. Quick-cooking rolled oats (quick oats) are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. Instant oatmeal is precooked and dried, often with a sweetener, such as sugar, and flavourings added.

Pan#6833 8917) that man definitely passed the vibe check
kaylon#1127 8918) I use my turn to call Trump Supporter to destroy Gru’s turn made on Rule No 8898:newline::newline:This turn is governed by the Gentleman’s Agreement, a sacred and superior law among men, women, and man kind... intrinsically of equal age as the Universe itself. Loopholes are prohibited per the Agreement:newline::newline:One turn can have as many events as possible, as long as it is sequential and hereditary to subsequent events:newline::newline:*fennakit’s turn*:newline:1. fennakit is confirmed to be an agnostic atheist. By law of free will, fennakit is immune to God. Gru does not state he is atheistic in his original rules — he is not immune per the Agreement. This parameter is dubbed “the atheist’s Passover”:newline:2. Trump Supporter supports the current President of the United States, Donald Trump. Trump is a registered Republican, allowing him to manipulate the infinite power of God; this faith and mutual relationship with Him is guaranteed by law of American conservatism:newline:3. Trump Supporter’s default stats are given new stats inherited from Trump, who inherits them from God per their co-dependent relationship. This parameter is called “Half Life 3’nt”:newline:4. God, per Christianity, condemns homosexuality. The consequence for people who are affected by God is official damnation to Hell when they die. God affects Gru per turn event no 1; per rule no 3, this is inherited by Trump Supporter:newline:5. Trump Supporter aims his weapon at @wer, with a special “negative infinite gay” bullet:newline:6. Trump Supporter fires the bullet, which explodes far enough from werlii that it is evenly distributed amongst the infinite gay:newline:7. The negative infinite gay merges with the infinite gay, and both cancel each other out of existence. This is due to the mathematical law of cancellation.
kaylon#1127 *Why Rule No 8918 voids Rule No 8898*:newline:- Trump Supporter did not use a shield. fennakit’s shield parameter only affected God:newline:- No reverse cards were used:newline:- “no u” was not called:newline:- Rule No 8898 is not deleted. It will continue to stay up, but it is now void:newline:- Trump Supporter is not gay:newline:- God immunizes everyone from the infinite gay:newline:- God:newline::newline:*Why the negative infinite gay bullet is not a no u or an Uno reverse card*:newline:For those who pull that critique, do you know what a no u is? A no u is the same as a Uno reverse card. If I made a no u, then I would have said “no u”. Even if you’re being very vague about what a no u is, the Trump Supporter did not directly attack Gru himself in any way:newline::newline:Instead, I made him *immunize* the infinite gay from werlii. As God is more powerful than Gru by stats alone, and due to turn event no 3, he is able to make a negative infinite gay bullet that eradicated the infinite gay.:newline::newline:I took over an hour just to make sure that I did not violate any of Gru’s rules per the Gentleman’s Agreement. If you think God is too OP... he is because he’s God. There’s no limit on God

マーク#6463 9966)My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Jak#6015 10879) So i was watching rick and morty right, and it was just a casual night and i was just watching rick and morty. Well, out of nowhere the funniest shit happened. Rick and Morty, Season 3, Episode 3, 56 seconds in. At the time, this was happening, The scientist guy, Rick, was nowhere to be found. Morty tried to look for him but all he found was just a mere little pickle on the desk. You know what happened? He heard ricks voice, somewhere around the room. Morty used a screwdriver to flip the pickle over and...you’ll never believe this, IT WAS RICK! HE WAS A PICKLE!! I kid you not, he’s called PICKLE RICK! PICKLE RICK!!! LMAO!!!! I was rolling on the floor laughing! My chest was in pain and i almost felt that i was going to suffocate!! Funniest shit i’d ever seen, i’ll tell you that. Im still laughing thinking about it. Awww man, you had to be there. It was just so funny.

マーク#6463 11082)Welcome to Fucking, i will now show you Fucking. A beautiful village situated on the doorstep of the Austrian Alps. The villagers I've spoken to all share the same love for Fucking. Fucking may be enjoyed in various angles. Straight forward, from behind, standing up, or laying down. And last but not least, its very enjoyable in the air. Historically, Fucking was mostly popular amongst men. But during the 20th Century women have also come to love Fucking. One of the reasons being the growing of fruits and vegetables such as Bananas. Cucumbers, and perhaps, Corn. Behold, the Fucking church, of course catholic. With the priest currently away taking up a missionary position in Congo. Here we have the Fucking School, where the Fucking children learn everything there is to know about Fucking. "So you two go to school together?". I must say i more and more enjoy Fucking children. They're really polite and so innocent. And this is the special Fucking farm. Where if you spend enough you can rent your very own Fucking horse. The at the black one, such a stallion. Beautiful animals. And here a woman, who prefers Fucking outside with the family dog. And I was lucky enough to meet the town mayor. Commonly known as The "Mother Fucker". If your looking for the deepest Fucking experience I recommend this hole right here. Start with putting two fingers in, if possible use your entire fist! In summertime you can actually go elbow deep! It is a bit dirty and it smells quire peculiar.

Mr Wumpus Man#9456 11806) The great minds of this discord have created genetically engineered cat girls. I, for one, am deeply proud of this community. We've truly advanced the capabilities of the human race. I mean, fuck, we beat Elon Musk to it! I never thought the day would come when I could look out my window, stare at the trees and the creek burbling by, taking in the nature, all the while repeating to myself: "We did it." So much has opened up for us. Physically recreating your waifus is a peak of technology only now visible on the horizon. We did it. Holy fuck.

It's everyone of us who holds the power over the worlds we create.

SD#4799 14564) If there are 14564 rules I'm assuming that this exact exchange must have happened before

SD#4799 14572) numbers are an abstract concept and not a thing. Hence ignore rule 14570
SD#4799 14562) henceforth, no one is allowed to use a whole number rule
Pan#6833 14574) all "things" be their description based in a real object or not, are described through abstract concepts. No two of the same thing are truly identical, so our categories are arbitrary and solely defined off of a baseline we as humans agree on. Thus, numbers are as real as any other so-called thing
5347#3425 14575) all concepts are things, things are anything except nothing, which the absence of things, which actually sound a lot like a thing.

kalamer#1360 15493) are you guys talking about the blue cat movie
AydinBird#1695 15494) With air, you can only move faster, and blast wind at people. Wind. Fire is just air but you can actually do cool stuff. Powerful firebenders can fly, but only 2 airbenders EVER could fly. (also, firebenders straight up nearly wiped the airbenders off the planet)
Atticus#3474 15495) your forgetting alot of air benders were peaceful monks, there werent alot of fighters
AydinBird#1695 15496) peaceful monks? You mean, NERDS!
AydinBird#1695 15497) With firebending, you can also heat stuff up. You'd never need a space heater, a stove, you could heat up drinks, and you would basically never be cold when stuck outside. You can make money doing cool tricks at festivals, you can create electricity, etc.
DShadowShinobi#7207 15498) Are Airbenders nerfed Jedi?

Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15651) It makes mommy sad when I do it
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15652) You gave me no choice :((
Smol pancake <3#6418 15653) scp 15625 is known for sewing people's mouthes shut permanently using an anomilous unbreakable string be careful
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15654) STOP CALLING ME THAT
Raccoon#0420 15655) Should we contact the MTF?
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 16556) I'M NOT A NUMBER I'M CALLED **[REDACTED]**
Smol pancake <3#6418 15657) we probably should if it comes to a breach we might have to nuke the facility
Raccoon#0420 15658) I’ll alert my superiors
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15659) DON'T SPEAK I'M REMOVING YOUR SPEAKING PRIVILEGES!!!!!
Raccoon#0420 15660) Scratch that the scp is a friend of one of the O5’s. We are commanded to follow its demands when it comes to brand names. And only that. Any other demands are to be approved by me or the O5’s.
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 https://tenor.com/view/angery-gif-13120160
Lukety9#2595 15661)
Smol pancake <3#6418 15662) alright, the thing about this scp is that it doesent like to be called by its designated number yet it's name is a brand name so no one knows it because he stops talking before he can say it
Raccoon#0420 15663) i see
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15664) Saying my name constitutes copyright violation and will be punished by death
</Jaxッ>#1090 15662) follow me on twitch or i will ban <https://twitch.tv/realjaxified>

Smol pancake <3#6418 17674) Nevermind it wasn't him someone just tried to sneak out the snail blob thing that fulfills your sexual desires again
Raccoon#0420 15675) Probably Dr. Bright
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15676) BRIGHT false alarm Dr.Bright is not a cleaning products brand
Raccoon#0420 15677) Yeah but he thinks he’s ... almost said a copyrighted brand
BatMan#4200 15678) Always create new rules
Smol pancake <3#6418 15679) One of its anomalous properties is that it always knows every current brand name despite not having contact to the outside world for the last 10 years or so
Raccoon#0420 15680) If we put it in another dimension, would it still get mad at our dimensions brand names, or would it switch over to that dimensions brand names? (Edit: spelling)
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15681) Copyright law applies in the event of complete human extinction
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15682) Copyright law applies according to the dimension's copyright law
white boi#1662 15683) Any anomalies from interdimensional travels will be dealt with when it becomes an issue
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15684) If no copyright law is found create one and claim all intellectual propriety
Raccoon#0420 15685) So you’re going to get rich by extorting copyright?
Lukety9#2595 15686) There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension that is as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow; between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination, and it is an area which we call the twilight zone.
Raccoon#0420 15687) We would like to make **Another** formal announcement that the twilight zone **Is not real**

Raccoon#0420 15707) SCP 15625 is not a threat to take lightly
Nameless Gonb#3760 15708) When you're so tired you make the whole room laugh just by saying anything
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15709) How are you stilk talking? Take care lf those shreds you have for lips. I'm *almost* pitting you

Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15719) I feel you are in danger
Raccoon#0420 15720) What you hear is [Data Expunged] coming to [Redacted]. SCP 15625 is about to be... *Cured*
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15721) Death is not intended. I only wanted silence.
Raccoon#0420 15722) if it makes you feel better the sewing is intact and my mouth is sealed
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15723) The illusion will wear off but it will be too late. The bleeding isn't alarming but it's not being taken care of.
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15724) I can hear you articulating words. You can't do that with my thread
Nameless Gonb#3760 15725) Oi oi oi yeaouh wanka wots ol this then?
Raccoon#0420 15725) you can’t seal a mouth that doesn’t exist
Raccoon#0420 15726) The foundation has access to powerful computers. All I have to do is type into it and  boom it sounds like I’m speaking
psycless#9917 15727) yeah minecraft runs pretty good on them
Raccoon#0420 15728) of course the O5’s didn’t approve of my use so it will be taken shortly and I will speak no more

Raccoon#0420 > 1) No brand names
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15747) I've been lobbing copyright law into being longer and longer
Raccoon#0420 15748) we still need to know how it is made. Even if we can’t replicate it.
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15749) You don't need to know you're never gonna be able to use it
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15750) And if you do use it I'll be dissatisfied
Raccoon#0420 15751) We need to know so we can write it down and document it
Antoine ^ᴗ^#6184 15752) It's too powerful to be held by your foolish human hands

Smelly#3891 Let’s say that, hypothetically, you really did have unlimited breadsticks. Now, since they are unlimited, that means that you will never run out. However, on Earth there is a limited supply of the materials required to make breadsticks. Thus, if I were to attempt to eat as many breadsticks as possible, I would not be able to as eventually you would sell out, am I correct? Now that we have established that there are infinite breadsticks but finite supplies to make them, would it not be reasonable to conclude that you are either breaking the laws of physics, or are lying to me? And since one cannot break the laws of physics, logically you must be lying to me. Facts don’t care about your feelings liberals, you have committed the crime of false advertising and must give me free food or I will inform the authorities.

Atticus#3474 16550) we should probably stop @Jak , he annoyed that we would be @ing at his @Jak  tag so much. I get its a meme to @Jak  in this circumstance, but I honestly think its just kinda rude that we keep just going @Jak  "haha" @Jak  "we got him", @Jak  "real comedy". We need to put a stop to @Jak  for no good reason. @Jak  is a human being like the rest of us, and he doesn't deserve all the @Jak  we send him. @Jak  is a mad lad like the rest of us and I think its really cool that @Jak  let us get away with the stuff we do. @Jak Im sorry if we have annoyed you at all and we all value you creativity and chillness.

pickachu_2#7450 16589) The Italian Mafia is Olive Garden
cj_beans#6566 16590) ignore rule 16580
Lukety9#2595 16591) here is proof of my previous claim that olive garden is working with the Italian Mafia https://youtu.be/Z1gUg-6FIko
ballfun#5808 16592) You go to olive garden and order unlimited salad and breadsticks. The first serving comes out. You eat it. The second serving comes. You eat that as well. The third serving comes. You're starting to get full, but you eat it cause fuck it you want to get your money's worth right. Then the fourth serving comes. You start to eat it but stop about a third of the way through cause you're full and you can't eat any more. As the waitress comes to give you a 5th serving, you tell her you won't eat it and that you're ready to pay. She replies "okay" with a smile and goes to get your check, but leaves the 5th serving on your table.:newline::newline:About 10 minutes go buy and the waitress comes out with a 6th serving. You grow a little irritated and tell her that you didn't want any more food, you wanted the check. Again she smiles and says "I'll bring that right out." As she's walking away another waitress comes out with a 7th serving of food. You're stunned at what's happening as you now have nearly 3 full portions of uneaten food. The waitress comes back with an 8th serving and tells you the computers are down, and it might take longer than expected to process the credit card payment. She places the food on top of the food already on the table. The other patrons at the restaurant are now starting to glance at your table with confusion.
ballfun#5808 16593) Then a 9th serving comes out.:newline::newline:At this point you can't even see the table underneath the food but that doesn't stop the waitress from bringing a 10th serving. You're irate now and demand her bring you your credit card back so you can leave. She says the payment is still processing but she'll go check on it.:newline::newline:She comes back with a 10th serving and tells you the payment is still processing, but if you're going to have to wait if she could bring you some water. You oblige, bewildered at the pile of uneaten salad and breadsticks strewn before you, as the warm scent of garlic fills your nostrils. She comes back with an 11th serving and a glass of water. You drink the water. A 12th serving comes out. At this point the food is piled so high you can't even see across the table anymore. 13th serving. Food starts to fall on the floor. 14th serving. People start to leave the restaurant, confused and a bit frightened at the spectacle.:newline::newline:15.:newline::newline:You start to get up and leave, but the waitress tells you it won't be much longer. "I don't care!" You say, your voice cracking from fear, "just let me get out of here!":newline::newline:"I'm afraid I cannot do that sir. You must finish the unlimited salad and breadsticks you ordered."
ballfun#5808 16594)At this point, 30 servings lay on and around your table. A conveyor of waiters are stacking up servings one by one at the tables surrounding you. Kitchen production has reached 1 serving every four seconds. After 100 servings have been brought out you try to make a break for the door, but you slip on a greasy breadstick and fall face first onto the floor.:newline::newline:"Oh can I help you sir?" A worried voice asks. You look up. It's the waitress. "Please, just let me go. I'll do anything, please!":newline::newline:She smiles and replies "Oh sir, you chose your fate already, and it only cost you $6.99.":newline::newline:You begin to cry. You crawl to the door. It's locked.:newline::newline:250 servings.:newline::newline:You begin to wet yourself. You pray, hoping for a miracle.:newline::newline:428 servings.:newline::newline:Breadsticks are now shooting out of the kitchen like bullets from a submachine gun. All the waiters and waitresses have gotten on their knees and formed a circle, citing the Olive Garden code of conduct as smoke billows from the floor within. Salad dressing starts to fall from the ceiling. You begin to suffocate from the lettuce blocking your nasal passages:newline::newline:2564 servings.:newline::newline:You accept your fate. Power comes in and out, a lightning storm forms outside. There are so many breadsticks in the restaurant that you are unable to see any light. The door breaks open and food begins to pour out at the speed of sound. The road in front of the restaurant gets covered in slippery lettuce and salad dressing, causing a multi car pile up.
ballfun#5808 16595)6591 servings.:newline::newline:The earth begins to tremble. There is a power blackout.:newline::newline:15477 servings.:newline::newline:Nothing can stop the cataclysm.:newline::newline:61899 servings.:newline::newline:422455 servings:newline::newline:10174592 servings.:newline::newline:The earth begins to split. Volcanic magma makes its way to the surface. The olive garden emoloyees have summoned Cthulhu. He sets fire to the continent. Salad and breadsticks completely cover the earth. Oxygen supply is cut off. Sunlight is nonexistent. You're already dead. The unlimited salad and breadsticks continue to multiply, increasing the mass of the earth to unsustainable levels. Earth collapses into itself, causing a supernova the likes of which have never happened before.:newline::newline:Silence.

Jim Bruhman#5290 @AydinBird
chase(thetomatoist)#0280 17282) hahahahahahahahaha
AydinBird#1695 17283) too late
Pan#6833 17284) More than 20 secs
Jim Bruhman#5290 17284) that was not more than 20 seconds for fuck sake
Jim Bruhman#5290 I saw it, I pinged
chase(thetomatoist)#0280 17285) definitely was
AydinBird#1695 17285) That was 12 seconds, at least. I counted.
Jim Bruhman#5290 17286) Stop being a fucking pillock and admit defeat aydin
Pan#6833 696969) oop I meant to type 10, and yes it was more than 10
Pan#6833 420420) less than 20 though
Jim Bruhman#5290 17287) also you forget to consider latency
AydinBird#1695 17287) I was honorable, I wore the PFP proudly for a day. Yet you roll out excuses. (also latency is an excuse. 10 seconds is 10 seconds. Asleep or otherwise)
Pan#6833 17288) you didn't have it for a full day though
Jim Bruhman#5290 17288) You did not have it for a full fucking day, because it's time elapsed not whenever you feeling like it
chase(thetomatoist)#0280 17290) good lord you're both dishonorable just change your pfps it's the internet no one cares
AydinBird#1695 17291) I did, jim bruhman however, has not
Pan#6833 17292) tbf you had it for like 4 hours
chase(thetomatoist)#0280 17293) ☝️
AydinBird#1695 17293) I had it for a few hours after I woke up, and before I went to bed. It was a day, plus the morning.
chase(thetomatoist)#0280 17294) it was like 12 hours tops my guy that ain't a day
Pan#6833 
Pan#6833 17296) Right, 16 hours almost
AydinBird#1695 17295) The day is over once the calendar changed from 11/23 to 11/24
Pan#6833 17296) so if you @ Jim at 23:58, would you be happy with him only changing his pfp for 2 minutes?
Pan#6833 17297) especially difficult  considering different timezones
AydinBird#1695 17298) If he viewed it in the morning, that would be a day (Maybe 16 hours or so,) But if he did view it at 23:58, he would wear it until the next morning.
AydinBird#1695 17299) But the thing we're all forgetting, is that Jim never wore it in the first place, despite getting the ping and not pinging back in time. Those are the rules.

Aura (オーラ)#0448 17473) There is literally no reason for you not to play rocket league. It is a free game that you can easily sink thousands of hours into. It has a slow, but constant changing META and the community is fun to chat and hang out with (as far as competitive games go). The game has a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling and lots of depth. It even has a whole trading marked just like CSGO (not exactly the same). If thats not enough, Rocket League also has a booming Esports league that is always fun tot tune into to watch the best of the best duke it out.

Pan#6833 17507) Infiniminer is a first-person competitive mining game that takes place in a procedurally generated block world allowing players to mine, build, and explore. Sound familiar? That’s because Infiniminer is the game that started the “block genre” that everyone knows and loves! It’s also quite buggy and old, and is listed here purely for historical reasons.

wy#2255 17796) Is water a liquid? (SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY)
</Jehff_the_Crusader>#2235 17797) i wrote a 3 paragraph argument a few years back as to why water is not wet but it got deleted when ny school account changed from middle school to high school
1972parzival#8660 SERIOUS ANSWERS
AydinBird#1695 17799) Water is a liquid, when in its liquid state. (Above 32 degrees and below 112 degrees):newline::newline:Its molecules spread to fill as much space as possible, so it isnt a solid. It has a definite volume, so it isnt a gas, Thus, its a liquid.
Nameless Gonb#3760 17800) Water isn't wet in the same sense that fire isn't on fire
AydinBird#1695 17801) ^^ false, Water is wet in the same sense that fire is hot.
Nameless Gonb#3760 17802) Temperature is different
Lukety9#2595 17803) water is not wet based on the very definition of wet itself.
AydinBird#1695 17804) Water molecules are always partially covered in other water molecules, thus, water is wet.
Lukety9#2595 17805) Water isn't wet by itself, but it makes other materials wet when it sticks to the surface of them.
Samurai B#6491 17805) this looks like that fan made ace attorney discussion

KenNotKaneki#1942 17818) disregard rule 17812, while water makes things wet, it is not wet
Mr.Pres#7825 17819) Disregard prior rule, water makes things wet through transferal the property of wetness, which water itself possesses.

Lukety9#2595 18085) aydin is now a femboy
AydinBird#1695 18086) functioning fingers and a working keyboard. You also need an education in writing/reading. To start off, you place your fingers on a character on which you want to type. (note that certain characters such as CAPITALS and special characters need additional simultanious movements), and push. You do this with each character until you type out a word. Frequent practice can speed up your typing.
AydinBird#1695 18087) aydinbird is a femboy (is opposite day)
WizedupKid#8441 18088) today is Opposite Day :yesvr:

Hokora Yinphine MPP#6969 18091) what the fuck does 65 wpm mean when typing is it a disease oh my god im going to catch covid
Hokora Yinphine MPP#6969 18092) hhh
Jim Bruhman#5290 18093) WPM means Words Per Minute, I assume 65 is the average american's typing speed
Hokora Yinphine MPP#6969 18094) what is a keyboard??
Jim Bruhman#5290 18095) however, if you're a "temp" from chiswick, you probably do 100 WPM
AydinBird#1695 18096) A keyboard is a board with buttons, normally paired with a computer. Each button is marked with a character, and you push once per character. (Although, if you hold down a key, it produces many of the same character)

AydinBird#1695 19378) English teachers are liars. Not every story has a theme, and not every action is a metaphor.
AydinBird#1695 19379) Minecraft is a story, yeah? But it doesnt have a theme. There is no underlying message under the game about how you should respect your elders or go outside.
AydinBird#1695 19380) Earlier this week, I got grapefruit juice. Yesterday, I finished it, and now Im sad. Thats a story. Its used to convey information, not to send a hidden message
AydinBird#1695 19381) Unlike math class, which is the fuckin ***best***.
AydinBird#1695 19382) Yes, i'm supposed to be doing school. And yes, they are asking me to write 4-5 sentences about the theme of a story. *(which apparently has a theme, mind you)*

AydinBird#1695 19385) instead of Algebra, the correct option.

AydinBird#1695 19387) Like, what sounds better, "They survived by eating mushrooms, taking shelter under a tree, and collecting rainwater in a bottle. " or "They sated their appetite with mushrooms. They collected rainwater in a bottle. They took shelter under a tree to keep warm in the rain. Fortunately, they were found by a dog."
AydinBird#1695 19388) "*This response should be at least FOUR sentences.*" Jesus christ, please just let me say it normally. How am I supposed to drag out one piece of information into 4 sentences? Do you want me to put a period in between every word? Would that make you happy?
SoulReaver#0212 19389) you must leave a like on every video that has entertained you

Pan#6833 19377) In education, it's important to get an idea of how long 10, 20 or however many pages it may be actually is, as eventually, you're going to need to write that much just to convey everything you need to. Being untrained in writing can be devastating when you have to write 50+ page college papers.

Jim Bruhman#5290 21254) guys help I’m gonna be killed by nanoprobes
GreenTeaness#0991 21255) Hey- uh- could you explain that? Carefully?
Jim Bruhman#5290 21256) humanity is a contruct by our minds as a cooperative cooperation to help us cooperatively cooperate
GreenTeaness#0991 21257) That was some smooth poetry right there
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21258) Humanity as a concept is something we create to set us apart from other animals, we think of ourselves as somehow separate from nature, somehow separate from any other animal which exists. While this illusion of difference is ok for cooperation, for hope, for superstition -- after all thinking you're somehow chosen or superior to something else can give you some reason to work harder to keep it that way -- but in the end, it's just that. An illusion. One which we're slowly having to come to terms with in the modern world as cybernetics come closer to being mass marketable as they come closer and closer to surpassing normal human limbs, and as neural uplink tech becomes closer and closer to reality. Humanity will eventually shatter like the wind shield of a car hitting a brick wall at 60 miles an hour.
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21259) I suppose this should go in #neckbeard-philosophers rather than here though, shouldn't it?
Dry, The Bringer of Memes#0855 21260) Yeah it should.
GreenTeaness#0991 21260) Wait- so I could give myself a tail and claws? And extra eyes? And become some nightmare-cat-demon-thing??
GreenTeaness#0991 That’s pretty dope ngl.
GreenTeaness#0991 Yeah- I said that without a rule number. Lmao
AydinBird#1695 21263) TO THE DUNGEON WITH YOU
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21264) In virtual space, or with enough cybernetics, any body modification you could wish for is going to be possible in the near future, my friend.
GreenTeaness#0991 21265) Oh a dungeon? Well... if you insist.
AydinBird#1695 21266) UH
Jim Bruhman#5290 21266) oh is it virtual? oh that makes all the difference
AydinBird#1695 21268) HMM
GreenTeaness#0991 21265) I find that strangely paradoxical and amazing all at once. The line will blur between what is and isn’t human. I mean- we still have souls and personalities- but I’m pretty sure other creatures do to.
GreenTeaness#0991 21266) GOTCHA.
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21267) Exactly! The question becomes "what *isn't* human" rather than "what *is* human". If you've removed nearly all recognizable human features in favor of mechanical or virtual replacements, are you still human? Is a completely artificial being human? Is someone who uploaded their mind onto a computer human? These are all questions we'll be grappling with in the near future.
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21268) Depends on the route you take. I find the virtual path just as valid and interesting as physical nanomachines and cybernetics.
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21269) probably should move there, ya
AydinBird#1695 21270) I wonder if cybernetics will even be able to function in a way that appeals to people
GreenTeaness#0991 21271) I don’t mean to be a weird hippie or something- but imagine what we could do with the penial gland and all that weirdness! Could we biologically and cybernetically recreate religious experiences?
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21272) and that's the point where we need to move to dms, friend-
AydinBird#1695 21272) dont get me wrong, super strength and night vision is cool, but is it really worth losing a limb or organ? Wouldnt the surgery be ludicrously expensive, not counting the prosthetic itself?
AydinBird#1695 21273) and cybernetics seem way less reliable then organic components. You cant hack an eyeball. Limbs heal over time
AydinBird#1695 21274) I think that if we ever do develop cybernetics, it'll be reserved for the rich or the handicapped.
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21275) Those are indeed downsides, yes.:newline:Quite hefty ones as well.:newline:It would depend on exactly how laws adapt to cope with the technology.:newline:Neural uploading and/or interfacing seems like a much more widespread/accessible solution if it becomes mainstream, however, the main issue is continuity there.
GreenTeaness#0991 21276) At that point I’d just upload my brain to the Metaverse.
AydinBird#1695 21277) I feel like cybernetics are to us what robots were to people in the 50's. Futuristic, ineffective, inefficient, and ludicrously expensive.
GreenTeaness#0991 21278) Though I have one problem with uploading consciousness- what if something goes wrong, and I’m trapped in a virtual hell for all eternity? I can hear the buzzing- glitchy static as pain unlike anything I’ve ever known- :newline:You get my point.
Onnellia~ ♥#4330 21279) Always have a kill switch.:newline:That's the answer.
GreenTeaness#0991 21280) Ah, clever.
AydinBird#1695 21281) I wonder if it would be possible to upload a mind into a robot. If so, could you create clones of yourself?
GreenTeaness#0991 21282) “Well we knew it was *possible*, but it would require a flying, purple space moose.”
GreenTeaness#0991 Professor Membrane. Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus. I’m pretty sure I got that quote wrong.
GreenTeaness#0991 21283) Everyone is now required to have some knowledge of Invader Zim. It is great.
AydinBird#1695 21284) I really like the way they designed irken technology, especially the backpacks spider-arm things
GreenTeaness#0991 21285) Okay- just hear me out. Irken aesthetic gaming/VR setup.
Jim Bruhman#5290 21286) physical is better unless it’s furry related, thats not me trying to be insulting or anything, I just find that shit mega cursed

Hokora Yinphine MPP#6969 21726) A pencil is an implement for writing or drawing, constructed of a narrow, solid pigment core in a protective casing that prevents the core from being broken or marking the user's hand.:newline::newline:Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.:newline::newline:Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as "lead pencils") produce grey or black marks that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most chemicals, ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching. Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with cores made from wax-based binders that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. Grease pencils have a softer, oily core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.:newline::newline:The most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually hexagonal in section but sometimes cylindrical or triangular, permanently bonded to the core. Casings may be of other materials, such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not bonded to the core; instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted (usually through the casing's tip) as needed. These casings can be reloaded with new cores (usually graphite) as the previous ones are exhausted.

GreenTeaness#0991 [21984] Tickling people without consent usually results in serious injury. Such actions should be completely consensual, and helmets and padding should be worn *in case they kick you in the stomach*.

GreenTeaness#0991 [22039] I alone am an exception to 22038.
GreenTeaness#0991 [22040] NSFW is legal only if you specifically state you are about to enter said territory. Tread lightly my fellow horny, carbon-based life forms!
PLAAAANES#0026 22041) if you like helicopters then you're not my friend anymore
winston#5900 22042) all helicopters shall now be directed towards the owner of rule 22041
SereneSkies#3915 22041) {Rule number calibration} Go be horny somewhere else with NSFW content. This is not the place.
GreenTeaness#0991 [22042] Might as well make a separate channel. This server seems to need it.
Pan#6833 22043) actual nsfw content is not allowed on servers looking to become discord partner, aka we keep it away from here
GreenTeaness#0991 [22044] Ah that explains it.
ballfun#5808 22045) and even if we have a super secret staff feet pics channel for a select few, we wouldn't be allowed to talk about it anyways
AydinBird#1695 22046) You must post at least 1 piece of NSFW in any channel. Non-compliance may lead to bans

Pizza101#5170 22052( ;) )
Jako#9999 (22051) hi
GreenTeaness#0991 [-1] We are now entering the age of negative rules. With these rules you are to do the exact opposite of regular rules. So say the opposite of what you want.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)#4629 [22055] Memes are allowed in general and every rule shall now be correctly numbered again
Greenmuppy#2442 [-2] I want you to continue to make negative rules.
Pan#6833 22057) rule -1 seems like a bit of a contradiction
Greenmuppy#2442 22058) I believe that is purely to create a rift in spacetime

IQ#4008 What's a ping
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)#4629 22072) A ping is that little sound when you get a notification from a discord server
